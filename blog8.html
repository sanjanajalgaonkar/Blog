      <p>
        Doctors and researchers are noticing some curious and unexpectedly
        positive side effects of the abrupt shifts in human behaviour in
        response to the covid-19 pandemic. Skies are bluer, fewer cars are
        crashing, crime is falling, and some other infectious diseases are
        fading from hospital emergency departments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other changes are unquestionably troubling. American doctors have
        expressed alarm over a nosedive in patients presenting to emergency
        departments with heart attacks, strokes, and other conditions, leading
        to fears that patients are too afraid of contracting covid-19 to seek
        necessary medical care. Calls to poison control centres are up by around
        20%, attributed to a rise in accidents with cleaners and disinfectants
        even before President Trump questioned whether injected disinfectants
        might stop the virus. Calls to suicide prevention lines are
        skyrocketing, while health experts are fretting about signs of rising
        alcohol and drug use, poorer diets, and a lack of exercise among those
        cooped-up at home. Millions of people are hungry and unemployed.
      </p>
      <p>
        But doctors, researchers, and public health officials say the pandemic
        is also providing a unique window through which to view some positive
        health effects from major changes in human behaviour. And the pandemic
        may lead to a public more willing to accept and act on public health
        messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice Pong, a paediatric infectious disease physician and the medical
        director for infection control at Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego,
        California, said the hospital has seen a sharp decline in paediatric
        admissions for respiratory illnesses. These include diseases such as
        influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human
        metapneumovirus
      </p>
      <p>
        “We track positive viral tests through our hospital lab and those
        numbers have gone down dramatically since everybody went into
        quarantine,” Pong told The BMJ. “We do think that’s a reflection of kids
        not being in day care or school.” The hospital is testing fewer
        patients, she said, which could be because more children might be
        staying home with respiratory symptoms. But more serious cases and
        intensive care unit admissions are down as well, suggesting a true
        decline in life threatening illnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the disease reducing effects of social distancing, Pong said she
        believes children and families are taking advice on hand washing,
        personal hygiene, and other prevention measures seriously. “I think this
        is going to be a good lesson for everybody,” she said. ‘‘The public is
        seeing why public health officials have advised them stay home when they
        feel sick, for example, and why they’ve emphasised hand washing and
        covering a cough or sneeze. Kids growing up now will know this is how
        germs are spread,” Pong said. That message could spread to their
        families and broaden awareness
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Fewer cars, blue skies</h2>
      <p>
        With covid-19 shutting down economic activity in most parts of the world
        and people staying closer to home, street crimes like assault and
        robbery are down significantly, though domestic violence has increased.
        Traffic has plummeted as well. As a result, NASA satellites have
        documented significant reductions in air pollution—20-30% in many
        cases—in major cities around the world. Based on those declines,
        Marshall Burke, an environmental economist at Stanford University,
        predicted in a blog post that two months’ worth of improved air quality
        in China alone might save the lives of 4000 children under the age of 5
        and 73 000 adults over the age of 70 (a more conservative calculation
        estimated about 50 000 saved lives). <br />
        Although baseline pollution levels in the US are lower, Burke said a
        similar 20-30% reduction in pollution would still likely yield
        significant health benefits. “A pandemic is a terrible way to improve
        environmental health,” he emphasised. It may, however, provide an
        unexpected vantage to help understand how environmental health can be
        altered. “It may help bring into focus the effect of business as usual
        on health outcomes that we care about,” he told The BMJ. “In some sense,
        it helps us imagine the future.” Getting there, he says, could instead
        come through better regulation and technology. <br />
        A separate report coauthored by Fraser Shilling, director of the Road
        Ecology Center at the University of California at Davis, found that
        highway accidents—including those involving an injury or fatality—fell
        by half after the state’s shelter-in-place order on 19 March. “The
        reduction in traffic accidents is unparalleled,” and yielded an
        estimated $40m (£32m; €37m) in public savings every day, the report
        asserted. <br />
        Whereas average traffic speeds increased by only a few miles per hour,
        traffic volume fell by 55%. Hospitals in the Sacramento region reported
        fewer trauma related admissions while other reports indicated fewer car
        collisions with pedestrians and cyclists. <br />
        In Washington, collisions on state highways fell even further—by 62%—in
        the month after the state’s stay-at-home order went into effect on 23
        March, compared with the previous year, according to the Washington
        State Patrol. The question, Shilling said, is whether researchers can
        learn from the information to design safer transportation patterns.
        “We’re not going to be guessing anymore about what happens when you take
        half the cars away,” he said. <br />
        Emptier highways, though, may be triggering reckless driving that could
        undo the mortality reductions. Washington State Patrol spokesperson
        Darren Wright said that troopers are seeing a “scary trend” of more
        drivers travelling at extreme speeds—a phenomenon also observed in
        Missouri. “We’re seeing speeds in the 120 and 130 miles per hour range,”
        Wright said. One motorcyclist was clocked at more than 150 miles per
        hour.

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Reassessing priorities</h2>
      <p>
        If the pandemic has prompted risky behaviour for some, it has encouraged
        others to embrace preventive measures. Randy Mayer, chief of the Bureau
        of HIV, STD, and Hepatitis at the Iowa Department of Public Health, said
        the public has become more responsive to calls from the department’s
        partner services, which perform contact tracing for people who test
        positive for HIV, gonorrhoea, and syphilis. “People are really
        interested in calling us back and finding out what information we have
        for them,” he said. That increased cooperation, Mayer said, may be a
        benefit of people associating public health departments with trying to
        keep them safe from covid-19. <br />
        Even so, he worries that a noticeable reduction in the number of new HIV
        diagnoses may partially reflect a reduction in available testing with
        many clinics open for limited hours, if not completely closed. But
        growing evidence suggests that more people are also heeding recent pleas
        by public health officials and even dating apps to reduce the risk of
        covid-19 infection by avoiding casual sex with new partners. Researchers
        in Portugal and the UK told The BMJ that they were beginning to see
        shifts in the incidence of sexually transmitted infections but were
        still collecting data to support their observations. <br />
        Miguel Duarte Botas Alpalhão, a dermatovenereologist and invited
        lecturer in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Lisbon, said
        that he expects to see a lower rate of sexually transmitted infections
        during the lockdown. The crisis has caused people to question their
        priorities “and how much they are willing to give up to protect their
        lives and those of their loved ones,” he said. “People are now more
        aware that nothing really matters when health is lacking, and this
        raised awareness may be the driving force towards healthier habits. We
        will have to wait and see.”
