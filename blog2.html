        I’ve referenced it in several posts, it’s a buzzword that we hear
        regarding mental health regularly and it effects musicians on a daily
        basis.
      </p>
      <p>Dopamine.</p>
      <p>What is it?</p>
      <p>
        Our brain is made up of chemical and electrical signals. These signals
        travel along synapses between neurons and cause us to experience the
        world through our five senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaking things down into majority statements you could say that
        electrical signals are responsible for anything related to movement,
        factual registration or practical intake and processing of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance if we see a forest fire, electrical signals will move
        through our brain registering that it feels hot, it smells smokey, it
        looks large and red, it tastes like ash, it sounds like a crackle or a
        roar. These are all intakes based on electrical currents moving across
        synaptic connections in the brain that we’ve built up over time to
        process and recognize a fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chemical signals are what tend to trigger our emotional responses. For
        instance, if you’re a firefighter, in full gear with a large hose, years
        of experience and a team of other firefighters with you, your fear level
        might be less than someone being evacuated who may feel large amounts of
        fear, chaos, loss, concern and sadness. And the emotional response to a
        small fire, in a fire place, may trigger emotional responses and
        memories of warmth, cozy winter nights or summer bonfires at the beach
        with s’mores. A very different recollection or processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dopamine, in the brain, is a neurotransmitter, or chemical released by
        neurons to send signals to other neurons. While dopamine is important in
        motor control and involuntary movements (that’s why I’m writing
        “majority statements” and not "all encompassing" hard facts...!) it does
        fall largely into the category of emotional response. Dopamine, more
        specifically, works in relation to reward-motivated behavior, or placing
        a value on a reward and it moderates the desire/motivation for that
        reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I know that after a performance I feel good and successful, that is
        because dopamine tells me so. As a result of this “reward” feeling at
        the end of a concert, I will continue to seek out concert-playing
        experiences so that I can attain more and more of this feeling. Dopamine
        reception is increasing my desire and motivation for that reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from making me feel good or excited about a reward, a system that
        transports dopamine efficiently will also help me to resist impulsive
        behavior and addictions, counteract depression and improve feelings of
        well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the next few weeks I’ll be exploring more of the ways in which
        dopamine affects our lives and productivity as musicians and performers
        as well as exploring some of the ways in which we alter it through
        addictive substances and poor lifestyle habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because dopamine is a major player in our physical practice habits as
        well as our mental health, I’ll be referring to this post often in both
        my Mental Health Monday posts and Workout Wednesday posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don’t often consider the science or medicine behind our music the way
        athletes look to sports science and medicine for improved performance.
        It’s time we integrate this information into our pedagogy and
        educational awareness if we want to achieve greater success and longer
        careers. Remember, our bodies should never limit our art, so train like
        an athlete to play like a musician.
