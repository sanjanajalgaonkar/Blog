      <img src="images/covid2.jpg" alt="blog5" class="blog-img" />
      <p>
        College students continue to grapple with the educational fallout of the
        pandemic. School closures exacerbate issues of digital access and other
        inequities. More and more students report feeling stressed and anxious
        due to COVID-19. Students on and off campus will navigate colleges'
        shifting plans well into 2021.<br />
        Before places of worship, restaurants, and shops began to close in
        response to the coronavirus pandemic, college campuses sent students
        home. The dominoes started to fall last spring. Many schools held out
        hope of resuming at least some on-campus classes and operations by fall.
        But over the summer, a growing number of colleges adopted online or
        hybrid learning models. According to The College Crisis Initiative, over
        half of U.S. colleges were partly or primarily online in the fall.<br />
        Neither colleges nor students were prepared for prolonged campus
        closures. Both face a variety of challenges going forward. Due to
        subsequent coronavirus outbreaks, some institutions have already been
        forced to close a second time.<br />
        College students — most of whom are under 29 years of age — are among
        the least vulnerable to COVID-19. The China Center for Disease Control
        found that the COVID-19 fatality rate for the 10-39 age bracket was just
        0.2%. The coronavirus poses the greatest threat to older faculty and
        staff, nontraditional students, and those with immunodeficiencies. In
        addition to protecting high-risk campus members, campus closures aimed
        to protect the local community. Before any students tested positive for
        COVID-19, models showed that college campuses could be hotbeds for virus
        transmission.<br />

        Students Confront Coronavirus and Campus Closures
      </h2>
      <p>
        Schools' diverse and active populations number in the thousands, all
        living in close proximity to one another. And as the surge in college
        disciplinary action suggests, social distancing measures can be
        difficult to enforce. Data shows a looser correlation between open
        campuses and rising case numbers than predicted. Some areas experienced
        short-term spikes in case numbers after the local campus welcomed
        students back. But counties with college campuses actually logged fewer
        new COVID-19 cases per day than counties without campuses. Most campus
        closures were enacted out of an abundance of caution rather than in
        response to confirmed cases. Now, many colleges have set a hard limit
        for how many positive cases their campuses can support before shutting
        down again. College students, already a vulnerable group in regard to
        mental health, have been profoundly destabilized by the pandemic.
        Surveys show a massive surge in stress and anxiety among students. For
        many, pandemic concerns revolve less around getting sick and more around
        the loss of grade points, college credits, and income.

        Students Anxious About Internet Access and Housing
      </h2>
      <p>
        For students figuring out where to go and how to get there, campus
        closures were like an eviction notice. The forced migration from
        in-person to online learning also deepened the digital divide — the gap
        between those who have access to the internet and technology at home,
        and those who do not. While over 88% of Americans are internet users,
        the share of Americans with computers hovers around 74%, according to
        Statista. Smartphones can get you online, but they aren't machine enough
        for video conferences, online quizzes, and essay-writing. Students who
        depend on campus operations for both resources and their livelihood
        dealt with extra repercussions. Many students worked on campus and
        struggled with loss of income when campuses closed. And those who called
        on-campus housing their permanent address were forced to patch together
        new plans, with many now facing homelessness. Out-of-state students
        without local support networks had to reckon with these challenges
        alone. International students remain particularly vulnerable: First
        travel bans compounded the difficulties of campus closures, then came
        the news that international students would not be able to stay in the
        U.S. to take online college courses.

        The Shift to Online Education Has Been Accelerated
      </h2>
      <p>
        The coronavirus pandemic has spurred the adoption of distance learning
        at all education levels. Thousands of colleges and universities, as well
        as hundreds of thousands of K-12 institutions, closed nationwide. The
        mass transition will be a proving ground for online education. Until
        this year, colleges' shift online had been steady but slow. While
        student enrollment in online education increases year over year, the
        newest BestColleges Online Education Trends Report found that more than
        half of the colleges surveyed did not plan to raise their online
        education budgets. <br />
        With the pandemic, schools rushed to fill gaps in their online
        infrastructures. Finding the money and experts to make those upgrades
        presented a hurdle, though. According to Melissa Venable, an online
        education advisor for BestColleges, "There aren't enough instructional
        designers and other learning support specialists to go around right now.
        These offices have not been a priority at all colleges and
        universities." If ad hoc digital solutions don't work for students and
        teachers, the experience could stymie online education's future growth.
        "This quick and mandatory shift may reinforce the most challenging
        aspects, leading some instructors to be less likely to adopt online
        education in the future," Venable said. Ramping up online education
        under present circumstances may not be ideal, but as Venable notes, "The
        focus is not about experimenting with technology, but an emergency
        response." The digital systems that colleges build to support students
        now will outlast the coronavirus and inform the digital approach to
        higher education going forward. Successes could even galvanize colleges
        to expand online offerings.

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">What Will the Spring Term Look Like?</h2>
      <p>
        The previous administration did not issue any national standards for how
        colleges should respond to COVID-19. President Joe Biden has made the
        first steps toward issuing such top-down guidance, directing the
        departments of Education and Health and Human Services to collaborate on
        best practices. While safety measures may become standardized, the
        learning models and calendars that institutions follow could look
        different from university to university — even from campus to campus
        within a university. Still, certain decisions, like that initial choice
        to close up last March, reverberate throughout the country. As for this
        spring, dozens of colleges have already announced a marked change: no
        spring break. Much like Thanksgiving break, spring break has been deemed
        too risky, potentially launching campus-bred infections out into the
        world and opening up campuses to infections once students return. Most
        of the colleges that will remove spring break from their academic
        calendars planned to start the winter term in late January or early
        February.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond shifting start and end dates, few institutions plan to change
        their approach for spring. In other words, most colleges that selected
        face-to-face, remote, or hybrid learning in the fall will stick to that
        same plan this spring. That includes the large California State
        University system, whose 23 campuses will remain virtual for the rest of
        the academic year. Some schools have already announced virtual
        commencements for the class of 2021, while others are holding out hope
        of graduating their students in person — a hope that hinges on low
        infection rates and vaccine rollouts.
