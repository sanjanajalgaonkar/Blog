      <h1 class="blog-title">10 Best Places to Visit on Earth</h1>
      <img src="images/rome.jpg" alt="blog1" class="blog-img" />
      <p>Here's a list of 10 best places to visit on Earth.</p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">1. Croatia</h2>
      <p>
        This Baltic beauty is just as popular as the Greek Islands with its
        celebrity rising even more so thanks to Game of Thrones (think Kings
        Landing and that walk of shame through the medieval cobbled streets of
        Dubrovnik).<br />
        The idyllic beaches and its day bars, the ancient buildings that form
        part of its buzzing nightlife, the fresh and hearty cuisine… and the
        opportunity to charter a boat to island hop along the azure Adriatic
        coast… are the hallmarks of a perfect holiday. <br />Dubrovnik, Split
        and Hvar were once taken over by tourists in peak summer, this may
        change in 2021, but do consider the lesser popular (but equally
        picturesque) areas up the coast such as Istria (borders Italy and
        Slovenia – add these both to the list too!), or for a point of
        difference go inland into the national parks such as Plitvice lakes and
        Krka Waterfalls.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">2. Norway</h2>
      <p>
        Scandinavia is seen as a (Covid) low risk destination, but with high
        impact i.e. filled with exciting experiences and renowned for its
        spectacular landscapes, charming villages and majestic mountains. The
        priceless Northern Lights (electrically charged particles from the sun),
        are a must-see experience to watch the lights sour across the sky above
        the Arctic Circle.<br />
        And while you’re there, board one of the most incredible rail journeys
        in the world – the Flåm Railway, which offers a panoramic view of some
        of the most stunning nature amongst the Norwegian fjords.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">3. Portugal</h2>
      <p>
        One of the Mediterranean’s best sun-and-sand destinations dotted with
        historic cities, world-renowned cuisine and natural landscapes.
        Something for everyone as it has become an increasingly popular wellness
        destination to unplug and unwind with some of the world’s best
        surfing.<br />
        Contiki is offering new self-care experiences such as its Portugal City
        and Surf adventure. A 2-night ‘Special Stays’ at Noah’s Surf House in
        Santa Cruise offers experiences including paddle boarding, skateboarding
        and morning sunrise yoga overlooking the country’s scenic coastline.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">4. Vienna via river</h2>
      <p>
        For those that have experienced Europe a few times and looking for a
        point of difference, consider a river cruise – it’s a unique way to
        explore Europe as you float past castles and quaint villages onboard a
        luxury ship (max 130 people), all while relaxing and sipping on wine
        from the rooftop deck. Think floating 5-star boutique hotel, restaurant,
        bar and yoga studio promoting ‘wellness on the water’.<br />
        Waking up to swans outside your window as you roll past misty waters,
        pure magic. And there is plenty of free time to explore the cities and
        towns. Vienna to Prague is my pick, sailing along the enchanting Rhine
        and Danube rivers stopping in the “City of Waltzes” to explore its
        artistic legacy, imperial palaces and historic treasures.<br />
        For your safety and protection – all Uniworld Boutique Collection ships
        have its air purified and rendered treated surfaces self-disinfecting in
        an odor-less, chemical free and sustainable way, decomposing microbes
        such as bacteria and viruses, including the coronavirus family.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">5. Southern Africa</h2>
      <p>
        Safari, safari, safari. To feel like you’re part of a David Attenborough
        documentary is pretty surreal – I had six young lions walk an arm’s
        reach by my group and then attack a buffalo right before our dumbstruck
        eyes – only to have the buffalo shake off SIX lions and then run off to
        warn its herd to steer clear and then beat a tree in with its HEAD to
        show its dominance against the lions. That kind of ‘live show’ doesn’t
        happen every day, which is the beauty of a safari – each day and night
        is different, you can only hope to catch the Big5 (lion, elephant,
        leopard, buffalo, rhino).<br />
        Plus add in the staggering Lions Head climb with 360 views of Cape Town,
        various nature walks and of course the beautiful spirit of the people –
        your vacation is complete.<br />
        Lion World Tours, African Travel and Adventure World Travel tailor make
        trips throughout Africa to suit your needs, passions and different level
        of soft adventure.<br />
        And opening in December 2020 is Red Carnation Hotel’s Xigera Safari
        Lodge set in Botswana’s unspoiled wilderness spanning 15,000 square
        kilometers in the heart of the Okavango Delta. This ultra-luxurious
        escape is dedicated to sustainability, with 12 phenomenal suites
        socially distanced and is 100% solar powered.<br />
        The tranquil haven offers Wellness in the Wilderness – soul-soothing,
        individually customized treatments that re-energize and nurture the body
        and mind by tapping into the natural healing powers of the peace and
        tranquility of the bush.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">6. Egypt & Jordan</h2>
      <p>
        How fascinating to step back in time to the land of the pharaohs, get
        lost at Valley of the Kings in Luxor, visit Giza’s colossal Pyramids and
        Great Sphinx and cruise the mighty river Nile which has many ancient
        monuments dotted along the edge – the history and stories to be heard is
        enough to bring out the explorer in anyone, not to mention ALL the mezze
        plates and hummus.<br />
        Then onto Jordan, also filled with World Heritage Sites and inspiring
        desert landscapes, Petra, considered a ‘world wonder’ with sites
        positioned over rocky landscape and an apparent mood that changes with
        the shifting light of dawn and dusk.<br />
        Trafalgar and Insight Vacations offer guided holidays and an opportunity
        to visit the Iraq Al-Amir Women’s Co-op, a community of women with a
        mission of self-empowerment and developing their crafts (stats show some
        of the highest unemployment rates for women are in the Middle East) –
        you’re welcomed to visit and join them, learn their way of life and give
        back to the community #MakeTravelMatter.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">7. South America</h2>
      <p>
        Take some time off and be one with nature and wellness – the Andean
        peaks, Amazonian rainforest (staying in eco lodges), Patagonian
        glaciers, Incan ruins (hike Machu Picchu, one of the seven wonders of
        the world!), Lima as a global gastronomy destination and relax on
        white-sand beaches.<br />
        For an unpackaged holiday tailored by you, Costsaver, takes you through
        South America; and now Uniworld Boutique River Cruises sails on the
        Amazon and includes Peru for a Machu Picchu exploration. Try a
        state-of-the-art skiff ride on the Yanayacu-Pucate River where you can
        kayak, canoe and swim in these famous waters with a possible sighting of
        a pink dolphin.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">8. Canada</h2>
      <p>
        A breath of fresh air for many, Canada presents thriving city highlights
        and plays host to an array of activity including hiking, biking,
        canoeing, camping, skiing, wildlife and more. Get lost and discover
        \Mother Nature’s bounties from the Rocky Mountains to the waters of
        Alaska and cover national parks, glaciers and historic villages of
        Western Canada. But also consider the mountains of Yukon or British
        Columbia are equally impressive to the Rockies. Luxury Gold covers a lot
        of ground with Majesty of the Rockies.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">9. Japan</h2>
      <p>
        A mix of Eastern traditions crossed with Western modernity, Japan is one
        of the oldest civilizations complete with diverse history, majestic
        temples and boasts 21 UNESCO World Heritage Listed sites; pristine
        natural scenery such as Mount Fuji and its forested hills, a chance to
        take a dip in a mineral-rich Onsen hot spring bath heated by geothermal
        forces which are said to offer ‘rejuvenating powers’; its freshly
        powdered ski fields in winter, and in spring the blooming of the cherry
        blossoms which peak in April.<br />
        Food and entertainment are important to Japanese culture, so while on
        holiday you must sample a range of the many delicious dishes that make
        up their traditional cuisine (while sipping on sake and singing karaoke,
        obviously). FYI – Japan is the birthplace of Karaoke and there are
        around 100,000 karaoke boxes and bars across the country. So find your
        favorite song and immerse yourself in the culture!<br />
        Embrace the timeless tradition and modern spirit of Japan’s iconic
        sites, to the soothing hot springs of Kotohira, then ponder over world
        peace in Hiroshima with Trafalgar’s Splendours of Japan.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">10. Australia and New Zealand</h2>
      <p>
        Yes I’ve listed two countries as one to fit into the Top 10, BUT they
        share the same qualities yet are completely unique from each other –
        incredibly diverse in nature, extraordinary scenery and endemic
        wildlife, and offer an interesting indigenous culture to be discovered
        (and they are both deemed incredibly low risk Covid countries).<br />
        While Australia is renowned for its picturesque coastlines and white
        sands, New Zealand is known for its breathtaking mountains and
        landscape.<br />
        Imagine snorkelling the Great Barrier Reef (one of the seven natural
        Wonders of the World and the biggest single structure made by living
        organisms), then head north to the Daintree Rainforest for its hikes and
        sleep in an eco-treehouse, then travel across to Uluru – such a
        spiritual place that draws you in like a vortex in the most magical
        way.<br />
        New Zealand offers contrast between its North and South islands – a
        plethora of natural wonders such as the Tasman Glacier made famous by
        The Lord of the Rings. Take a scenic journey through Fiordland National
        Park and out to the unmissable Milford Sound.<br />
        AAT Kings and Insight Vacations arranges short breaks and guided
        holidays all throughout these two destinations.
