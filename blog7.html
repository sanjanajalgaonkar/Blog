      <img src="images/usa.jpg" alt="blog7" class="blog-img" />
      <p>Here's a list of 6 best states to visit in USA</p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">1. New York</h2>
      <p>
        Everybody wants to go to New York. The Big Apple has been featured in
        tons of movies, and is a must visit city otherwise your trip to America
        would be incomplete. In New York City, you can visit the Statue of
        Liberty, Central Park, the Empire State Building, Wall Street, United
        Nations Headquarters, the new World Trade Center, and Times Square. You
        can also visit Broadway or go for a music concert; there are many held
        in the city by famous musicians, or wine and dine at five-star
        restaurants around the city. Niagara Falls — three massive waterfalls in
        Buffalo, New York should be in your itinerary when you’re in this
        American city as well. The falls receive over 14 million visitors
        annually making them one of the world’s most visited tourist’s
        attractions! The Corning Museum of Glass in Finger Lakes is also located
        in New York, and is actually one of the top visited destinations by
        Asian tourists in the U.S.!
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">2. Washington D.C</h2>
      <p>
        Washington D.C. is the capital city of the US and where you will find
        the White House, where the U.S. president lives (when he’s not at his
        penthouse in New York or mansion in Palm Beach). You can take photos
        outside the White House, or schedule a tour inside of it, which will
        surely make your trip memorable. To learn more about American history
        you can also visit the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, Jefferson
        Memorial, and The National Archives. A trip to Capitol Hill, the home of
        the U.S Congress will also be worth your time.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">3. Florida</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re looking to have the perfect beach holiday in the U.S. then
        head over to Florida. The Sunshine State has year-round warm weather,
        amazing beaches and tons of outdoor activities you can enjoy. In 2018
        Florida was voted the number one place where US travelers would love to
        spend their summer. That shows you how awesome this state is! If you
        decide to make a trip to Florida, here are some places you can visit for
        some R&R: New Smyrna Beach. The sunsets in this city are intense. During
        the day you can swim and surf at the beach or play some beach
        volleyball. If you’re into art there are a number of art galleries you
        can visit. Key West. Happy hour at this island starts at 3p.m, this goes
        to show you how laid back the place is! I recommend you visit the Key
        West Aquarium where you can feed sharks and enjoy marine life displays.
        Amelia Island. Apart from just chilling on the pristine beaches, you can
        try kayaking or play a couple of rounds of golf. The island also has
        amazing seafood which you can enjoy while taking a sunset boat cruise.
        Palm Beach Island. Home to the rich, famous, and legendary, but also
        accessible to tourists wanting a truly posh and fabulous American
        experience. Recognizable figures like the Kennedy’s, Audrey Hepburn, the
        Pulitzer’s, and even Donald Trump have had homes on the island, and it’s
        where you’ll find Worth Avenue, which is the equivalent of Rodeo Drive
        in Beverly Hills.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">4. Hawaii</h2>
      <p>
        This is another wonderful U.S destination to take a beach holiday! The
        state has over 100 islands but only seven are inhabited. Some of the
        Hawaii islands include Hawaii, which is the biggest, Maui, Kauai,
        Molokai, Lanai, Niihau and Kahoolawe. The weather in Hawaii is beautiful
        all year round so you can plan a trip there at any time. Activities you
        can indulge in when on holiday in Hawaii include whale watching,
        surfing, touring volcanic sites and sunbathing at the beach. There’s
        also some of the most stunning hikes to do, including the famous
        Stairway to Heaven. Hawaii is also the place where the 44th President of
        the United States Barrack Obama was born. So when you visit the island
        you can get to see where he grew up!
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">5. California</h2>
      <p>
        LA is the second largest city in the United States and a huge tourist
        magnet (also where Alyssa, the founder of this website has a home
        base!). In 2017 close to 48 million people visited Los Angeles and the
        City mayor hopes to increase this number to 50 million by 2020. Visit
        the Hollywood Walk of Fame and take photos next to stars with names,
        hand, and footprints of your favorite actors and musicians. Go up to the
        famous Hollywood sign you have seen in hundreds of movies if you’re
        willing to hike (see this post for hiking directions). Go to the venue
        where the Oscars are held annually, Dolby Theatre. Chill at Venice Beach
        and peruse the quirky art stands along the boardwalk. Take photos at the
        famous Melrose Avenue wall murals. Window shop (or for real shop) at the
        luxury stores on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Have dinner and a movie
        at The Grove. Have some fun at Universal Studios where you can ride
        movie themed rollercoasters like Transformers-The Ride 3D and The
        Jurassic Park Ride. Of course, there’s tons of other things to do in
        California as well! There’s San Diego, San Francisco, Napa Valley, and
        let’s not forget, some of the most famous National Parks!
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">6. Nevada</h2>
      <p>
        I couldn’t finish this article without mentioning the US state where Sin
        City, as Vegas is popularly known, is located in Nevada! The city is
        widely known for its gambling scene but it has a lot more to offer than
        that. When you visit this vibrant city you can enjoy its lit nightlife,
        attend riveting concerts and performances, go to the city’s theme parks
        or attend endless pool parties. Las Vegas is all about fun, fun and more
        fun, that’s why it has been dubbed the entertainment capital of the
        world. So when you make a trip there be prepared to have a blast, and
        remember what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Nevada is also home to
        some stunning National Parks as well like Death Valley, and is very
        close to the famous Grand Canyon!
