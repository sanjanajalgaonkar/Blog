      <h1 class="blog-title">5 Best Cities to Visit in India</h1>
      <img src="images/indiancity.jpg" alt="blog4" class="blog-img" />
      <p>Here's list of top 5 best cities to visit in India</p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">1. Agra</h2>
      <p>
        Home of the magnificent Taj Mahal, Agra is one of the top cities in
        India to visit. While in Agra, travellers can explore one of the New
        Wonders of the World (the aforementioned Taj Mahal), which is a
        mausoleum built in honour of Shah Jahan’s favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal,
        which still holds her remains. There are also two other World Heritage
        Sites in Agra, one being the Agra Fort (near the Taj Mahal) and the
        other being Fatehpur Sikri, a beautiful smaller area near Agra with
        sandstone buildings and mosques.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">2. Goa</h2>
      <p>
        Although Goa is a state, I couldn’t help but include it as one of the
        best places in India to explore. Home to Dudhasagar Falls, a 600-meter
        high waterfall on the Mandovi River, and Fort Aguada Beach, which boasts
        a long sandy bays that are pure bliss. There is also a handful of
        religious sites to see whilst in Goa, including the Se Cathedral and the
        Basilica of Bom Jesus. Essentially, if you’re looking for a break from
        the hustle and bustle of city life – Goa is where you really should be
        headed for.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">3. Manali</h2>
      <p>
        Although, technically a town, Manali is easily up there as one of the
        best places to visit in India. Manali boasts some absolutely stunning
        cascading waterfalls along with rather lush plants and interesting
        wildlife. Manali is one of those places in India that will totally take
        you by surprise and challenge your pre-conceived notion of India
        starting with snow-capped mountains (the Himalayas are here you see),
        green valleys, and towering waterfalls. You can even go skiing here. If
        you’re looking to do some ice-skating, skiing and a spot of light
        hiking, head over to Rhotang Pass too – it’s stunning. That being said,
        in Solang Valley, you can see the enormous glaciers from deep within the
        valley itself.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">4. Mumbai</h2>
      <p>
        Famed for being the largest and top cities in India to visit, Mumbai is
        an assault on the senses. In the best way, of course. When you’re here
        be sure to walk under the Gateway of India, a work of architecture and a
        landmark that has stood in Mumbai since 1924. Also, meander along the
        shore of the Arabian Sea and take some time to explore the Haji Ali, a
        beautiful tomb and religious site that holds the remains of a Muslim
        Saint. For beaches, Juhu is a lovely place to, take a dip, or enjoy a
        beautiful sunset dinner overlooking the bay. Out in the harbour,
        Elephanta Island is also an intriguing attraction with ancient carvings
        laid out on the walls.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">5. Jaipur</h2>
      <p>
        Often called the “Pink City,” Jaipur is a hub a life and a
        treasure-trove of Indian history. It’s easily up there as one of the top
        cities in India to explore. If you’re visiting Jaipur, make sure to
        experience a Jeep safari through Nahargarh Sanctuary, get their blood
        pumping on a zip line through jungle-like areas, or even see the desert
        city from up above in a hot air balloon. If you’re looking for a little
        more culture, pay a visit to Amer Fort or Nahargarh Fort where you will
        feel as though they have stepped back in time.
