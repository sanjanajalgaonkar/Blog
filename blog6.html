      <p>
        COVID-19 is not only a global pandemic and public health crisis; it has
        also severely affected the global economy and financial markets.
        Significant reductions in income, a rise in unemployment, and
        disruptions in the transportation, service, and manufacturing industries
        are among the consequences of the disease mitigation measures that have
        been implemented in many countries. It has become clear that most
        governments in the world underestimated the risks of rapid COVID-19
        spread and were mostly reactive in their crisis response. As disease
        outbreaks are not likely to disappear in the near future, proactive
        international actions are required to not only save lives but also
        protect economic prosperity.

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Covid-19 and the Economy</h2>
      <p>
        On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized
        COVID-19 as a pandemic, pointing to over 3 million cases and 207,973
        deaths in 213 countries and territories . The infection has not only
        become a public health crisis but has also affected the global economy.
        Significant economic impact has already occurred across the globe due to
        reduced productivity, loss of life, business closures, trade disruption,
        and decimation of the tourism industry. COVID-19 may be that a “wake-up”
        call for global leaders to intensify cooperation on epidemic
        preparedness and provide the necessary financing for international
        collective action. There has been ample information on the expected
        economic and health costs of infectious disease outbreaks (2, 3), but
        the world has failed to adequately invest in preventive and preparedness
        measures to mitigate the risks of large epidemics. With globalization,
        urbanization, and environmental change, infectious disease outbreaks and
        epidemics have become global threats requiring a collective response.
        Although the majority of developed countries, predominantly European and
        North American, have strong real-time surveillance and health systems to
        manage infectious disease spread, improvements in public health capacity
        in low-income and high-risk countries—including human and animal
        surveillance, workforce preparedness, and strengthening laboratory
        resources—need to be supported by using national resources supplemented
        with international donor funding. International collective action among
        governments, non-government organizations, and private companies has
        been advocated in building and financing technological platforms to
        accelerate the research on and development response to new pathogens
        with epidemic potential (2, 4). In the case of COVID-19, such
        cooperation is critical, especially for the development and production
        of a vaccine. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations
        (CEPI), a global partnership launched in 2017, has tracked global
        efforts in COVID-19 vaccine development activity and is advocating for
        strong international cooperation to ensure that vaccine, when developed,
        will be manufactured in sufficient quantities and that equitable access
        will be provided to all nations regardless of ability to pay.
        Furthermore, affected countries may benefit from exchanging
        technological innovations in contact tracing, such as health Quick
        Response (QR) codes, to manage the outbreak more effectively. However,
        there are important privacy implications that need to be considered. In
        the case of COVID-19, the collective response and adoption of preventive
        measures to stop the global spread were implemented too late, after
        COVID-19 had already penetrated other regions through international
        travel. Figure 1A presents the dynamics of confirmed COVID-19 cases and
        shows that large countries in Europe (e.g., Italy, Germany, and the UK)
        and the U.S. have already outnumbered China, the origin of epidemic, in
        the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.<br />
        In addition to the substantial burden on healthcare systems, COVID-19
        has had major economic consequences for the affected countries. The
        COVID-19 pandemic has caused direct impacts on income due to premature
        deaths, workplace absenteeism, and reduction in productivity and has
        created a negative supply shock, with manufacturing productive activity
        slowing down due to global supply chain disruptions and closures of
        factories. For example, in China, the production index in February
        declined by more than 54% from the preceding month's value. In addition
        to the impact on productive economic activities, consumers typically
        changed their spending behavior, mainly due to decreased income and
        household finances, as well as the fear and panic that accompany the
        epidemic. Service industries such as tourism, hospitality, and
        transportation have suffered significant losses due to reduction in
        travel. The International Air Transport Association projects a loss in
        airline revenue solely from passenger carriage of up to $314 billion .
        Restaurants and bars, travel and transportation, entertainment, and
        sensitive manufacturing are among the sectors in the U.S. that are the
        worst affected by the COVID-19 quarantine measures . The advance
        seasonally adjusted insured unemployment rate in the U.S. has already
        reached a record level of 11% for the week ending April 11, 2020.<br />
        In addition to marked health inequalities, especially in countries
        without universal healthcare coverage, the economic impact of the
        COVID-19 pandemic will be heterogeneous across the country's income
        distribution. For example, office workers are more likely to transition
        to flexible working arrangements during the restrictions, while many
        industrial, tourism, retail, and transport workers will suffer a
        significant reduction in work due to community restrictions and low
        demand for their goods and services.<br />
        Global financial markets have been heavily impacted by the effects of
        COVID-19 spread. As the numbers of cases started to increase globally,
        mainly through the US, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Iran, and South
        Korea, the world financial and oil markets significantly declined. Since
        the start of the year, leading U.S. and European stock market indices
        (the S&P 500, FTSE 100, CAC 40, and DAX) have lost a quarter of their
        value, with oil prices declining by more than 65% as of April 24, 2020
        (Figure 1B). Daily data on stock market volatility and price movements
        are good indicators of consumer and business confidence in the economy.
        There were significant negative relationships between the daily number
        of COVID-19 cases and various stock indices (Figure 2). The correlation
        ranges from −0.34 to −0.80. <br />
        Larger economic problems are associated with the current and potential
        future demand for oil translating into fluctuations in oil prices due to
        reduced economic activities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Expected
        excess supply was also responsible for significant price reductions. If
        lower than expected oil prices continue, many oil-dependent economies
        may contract following reductions in trade and investment. Shocks to the
        labor markets will be severe, especially for countries dependent on
        migration. Globally, migrant workers make important contributions to the
        labor markets, addressing imbalances in both high- and low-skilled
        occupations (11, 12). As international travel restrictions and
        quarantine are likely to remain for the foreseeable future as countries
        try to halt the spread of COVID-19, migration flows will be limited,
        hindering global economic growth, and development.

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        As the spread of the virus is likely to continue disrupting economic
        activity and negatively impact manufacturing and service industries,
        especially in developed countries, we expect that financial markets will
        continue to be volatile. There is still a question as to whether this
        unfolding crisis will have a lasting structural impact on the global
        economy or largely short-term financial and economic consequences. In
        either case, it is evident that communicable diseases such as COVID-19
        have the potential to inflict severe economic and financial costs on
        regional and global economies. Because of high transportation
        connectivity, globalization, and economic interconnectedness, it has
        been extremely difficult and costly to contain the virus and mitigate
        the importation risks once the disease started to spread in multiple
        locations. This warrants international collective action and global
        investment in vaccine development and distribution, as well as
        preventive measures including capacity building in real-time
        surveillance and the development of contact tracing capabilities at the
        national and international levels. As outbreaks of novel infections are
        not likely to disappear in the near future, proactive international
        actions are required not only to save lives but also to protect economic
        prosperity.
