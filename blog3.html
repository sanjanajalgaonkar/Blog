      <p>
        One of the questions I constantly hear in my day to day practice is
        “what is music therapy?” which is usually followed by “I’ve never heard
        of it before.” If you are one of the people who are unaware of what
        music therapy is, here are 5 things you need to know which will help
        answer that question! Music therapy has been gaining much more publicity
        with social media so why not add another source to the list.

        Music Therapy is an Accredited Health Care Profession
      </h2>
      <p>
        Music therapy has been an accredited profession since the 1950s, however
        most people are not aware of this. When most people think of therapists
        their minds go to the classic Freudian psychologist, speech therapists,
        occupational therapists or physical therapists. Music therapists should
        also be considered in this list as we are similar to the other therapies
        in that we work towards non-musical goals, provide documentation towards
        progress, are well educated in the areas of music and psychology,
        accredited and certified to practice, and often times we can co-treat
        alongside other therapies to help you achieve quicker and better
        results. Currently, there are around 5,000 board certified music
        therapists working in the United States. Each one has completed at least
        an undergraduate degree in music therapy, has completed a required 1,040
        hour internship and passed the national board certification exam
        required by our professional organization in order to practice. In
        addition to this, our profession requires continuing education to keep
        this certification, so we are constantly improving ourselves to benefit
        you! So remember, if your music therapist doesn’t have the credentials
        of MT-BC (Music Therapist, Board Certified) then they are not a true
        music therapist
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">You DON’T Have to Be a Musician to Benefit!</h2>
      <p>
        I have had countless participants express to me at the beginning of a
        session, “I’m not a musician so I don’t know how good I’ll be”, or “I
        can only play the radio”. The truth of the matter is, music therapists
        strive to make sessions non-musician proof, meaning that we want you to
        have a successful musical experience and be fully involved even if you
        have no idea how to play a note. More often than not we are actually
        working with people who do not consider themselves musicians. If you are
        one of these people I encourage you to consider that you actually ARE a
        musician! Everyone has an inherent rhythm which is our living,
        breathing, physical body. Every part of you is made up of millions of
        tiny rhythms all working together, from our hearts all the way down to
        our cells. In music therapy the therapist works with you to successfully
        create music and be a part of a powerful musical experience even if you
        have never had any formal musical training.

        Music Therapy Can Benefit ALL Populations (Even Healthy People!)
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of my favorite observations is when I work in the hospital treating
        cancer patients while they receive chemotherapy. I enter the room and it
        is mostly quiet with only the sounds of beeping and televisions buzzing
        from the patients barricading themselves off from their surroundings.
        How quickly the atmosphere changes once music is introduced! Before you
        know it everyone in the room is focusing on the music, interacting with
        those around them, smiling, relaxing and even the staff gets involved by
        singing along and participating in discussions. Not only am I treating
        the patients, but their loved ones and the staff are receiving benefits
        as well. That is one of the unique characteristics of music therapy…
        everyone around is effected and can benefit, even if they are not the
        targeted patient being treated. Music has the power to express when
        words cannot be found, guide when there is no sight, uplift when the
        spirit is broken, teach when one struggles to be taught and so much
        more. I have yet to find a population that music therapy cannot aid in
        treating.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Music is a Whole Brain Process</h2>
      <p>
        The crazy thing with music and the brain is that no one area of the
        brain processes music alone. There are so many different aspects of
        music that even if half of your brain is removed you will still respond
        and be able to decipher it to some extent because both hemispheres play
        a part in musical processing. This is why music therapy is so effective
        with victims of brain injuries. Music very often can bypass where the
        injury is and lead to new connections aiding in recovery or relearning.
        In addition, memories of music are also stored throughout your brain,
        not just one localized section. Have you ever witnessed someone with
        dementia finish an entire chorus of a song with just a few notes
        reintroduced? I do almost every day! Try it on yourself! Just by hearing
        a few notes of a song you haven’t heard in years you will be surprised
        how much of the song you can continue to sing. Long story short, our
        brains are heavily influenced by music and there are connections to
        music throughout them making it a great therapy especially when a
        neurological impairment has occurred.

        Music Therapy is Very Effective… We Have Research
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are countless publications in the Journal of Music Therapy and
        Music Therapy Perspectives the two largest periodical collections put
        forth by our organization, AMTA (The American Music Therapy
        Association). You can find numerous studies and abstracts simply by
        searching Google or visiting the AMTA website (click the link to access
        bibliographies for specific populations). So why is music therapy so
        effective? There are many reasons, in fact too many to get into in this
        post, but consider #4 as mentioned above, the fact that nearly everyone
        on the planet enjoys music to some extent, music is fun and non-invasive
        which always helps with motivation, and it has the ability to affect us
        physically, emotionally, cognitively and spiritually. The best part is
        that music therapy can affect all of these things at the same time!
